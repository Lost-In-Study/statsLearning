(a) 1-1/n
(b) 1-1/n
(c) from 1 to n, every time the probablity that the jth observation is not in the sample is 1-1/n, iterate n times, the it's (1-1/n)^n
(d) 1-(1-1/5)^5
(e) 1-(1-1/100)^100
(f) 1-(1-1/1000)^1000
(g)
(h)

3. 
(a) split the dataset into k non-overlapped same-sized sets, each set as the validation set and the remaining as the training set, 
then repeat k times, average k mse.
(b) 
i  compared to validation set, k-fold more complex, but validation set tend to overestimate the error
ii to LOOCV, loocv requires more compution, and higher variance, lower bias

4. 
bootstrap: resampling the data b times, fit the model b times, average the RMSE
