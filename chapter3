t-statistic, p-value
In Table 3.4, the null hypothesis for "TV" is that in the presence of radio
ads and newspaper ads, TV ads have no effect on sales. Similarly, the null
hypothesis for "radio" is that in the presence of TV and newspaper ads, radio
ads have no effect on sales. (And there is a similar null hypothesis for
"newspaper".) The low p-values of TV and radio suggest that the null hypotheses
are false for TV and radio. The high p-value of newspaper suggests that the null
hypothesis is true for newspaper

3. Y = 50 + 20(gpa) + 0.07(iq) + 35(gender) + 0.01(gpa * iq) - 10 (gpa * gender)
(a) female: gender=1 Y=50+20(gpa)+o.o7*iq+35+0.01*iq - 10*gpa
    male:   gender=0 Y=50+20*gpa+0.07*iq+    0.01*iq
    (iii) correct
(b) Y=50+20*4+0.07*110+0.01*440-10*4=137.1
(c) false, should see p-value
